### Instructions

The following commands should be run from the root directory of the CasperLabs repo.

#### Build the node

```
sbt node/universal:stage
```

The `casperlabs-node` executable will be found here:

```
./node/target/universal/stage/bin/casperlabs-node
```

#### Build the client

```
sbt client/universal:stage
```

The `casperlabs-client` executable will be found here:

```
./client/target/universal/stage/bin/casperlabs-client
```

#### Build the casperlabs-engine-grpc-server

```
cd execution-engine
cargo build --release

The `casperlabs-engine-grpc-server` executable will be found here:

```
./target/release/casperlabs-engine-grpc-server

```

#### Build the Mint and Proof-of-stake Contracts

```
cd execution-engine
cargo build -p pos --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo build -p mint-token --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

The compiled contracts will be found here:
```
./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/pos.wasm
./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/mint_token.wasm

  # For repeating configs, we could use extension fields: https://medium.com/@kinghuang/docker-compose-anchors-aliases-extensions-a1e4105d70bd
  # or docker-compose.override.yml as described in https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/

  # Not going to expose ports on the host because there will be many nodes.
  # We can use a docker container to run the client and connect to the right casperlabs network
  # and pick one particular node.

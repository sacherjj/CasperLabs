       And: Contract at path "helloworld" has been called from Node-1, Node-2, Node-3 and its value will be asserted

  # Not Implemented
  Scenario: Orphaned blocks
      # TODO: Convert into steps
      # Create a network of N nodes, perform a deployment of a contract when the node is very busy
      # Confirm that the deployment went through
      # Wait to hear back about which block it landed in
      # Orphan the block
      # Confirm that the contract is not in the global state
      # Check the account balance that funded the deployment and confirm that no funds were deducted for the deployment (it was not finalized)

  # Implemented test_bonding.py : test_bonding
  Scenario: Bonding a validator node to an existing single node network
    Given: Single  Node Network
     And: A bonded Validator.
     When: New node joins.
     And: Deploys bonding request.
     And: That bonding request is valid.
     Then: New node becomes bonded.
     And: Starting from new block new node can be found in bonded validators set.

  # Implemented test_bonding.py : test_double_bonding
  Scenario: Bonding a validator node twice to an existing single node network
    Given: Single  Node Network
     And: A bonded Validator.
     When: New node joins.
     And: Deploys bonding request.
     And: That bonding request is valid.
     Then: New node becomes bonded.
     And: Deploys bonding request again with same stake.
     And: That bonding request is valid.
     Then: Bonded stake of Node becomes twice.
     And: Starting from new block new node can be found in bonded validators set.

  # Implemented test_bonding.py : test_invalid_bonding
  Scenario: Bonding a validator node to an existing single node network
    Given: Single  Node Network
     And: A bonded Validator.
     When: New node joins.
     And: Deploys bonding request with bonding amount greater than 1000 times of the total of the current staked amount .
     And: That bonding request is invalid.
     Then: New node is not bonded.
     And: Starting from new block new node cannot be found in bonded validators set.

  # Implemented test_bonding.py : test_unbonding
  Scenario: Unbonding a bonded validator node from an existing network.
    Given: Single  Node Network
     And: A bonded Validator.
     When: New node joins.
     And: Deploys bonding request.
     And: That bonding request is valid.
     Then: New node becomes bonded.
     And: Starting from new block new node can be found in bonded validators set.
     And: Deploys unbonding request.
     Then: Node becomes unbonded from network.
     And: Starting from new block new node cannot be found in bonded validators set.

  # Implemented test_bonding.py : test_partial_unbonding
  Scenario: Unbonding a bonded validator node with partial bonding amount from an existing network.
    Given: Single  Node Network
     And: A bonded Validator.
     When: New node joins.
     And: Deploys bonding request.
     And: That bonding request is valid.
     Then: New node becomes bonded.
     And: Starting from new block new node can be found in bonded validators set.
     And: Deploys unbonding request with partial amount of bonded amount.
     Then: Node still bonded to the network but with reduced stake.
     And: Starting from new block new node cannot be found in bonded validators set.

  # Implemented test_bonding.py : test_invalid_unbonding
  Scenario: Unbonding a bonded validator node from an existing network.
    Given: Single  Node Network
     And: A bonded Validator.
     When: New node joins.
     And: Deploys bonding request.
     And: That bonding request is valid.
     Then: New node becomes bonded.
     And: Starting from new block new node can be found in bonded validators set.
     And: Deploys unbonding request with amount greater than 90% of the total current staked amount.
     Then: Node still is bonded in network.
     And: Starting from new block new node can be found in bonded validators set.

  # Implemented test_bonding.py : test_unbonding_without_bonding
  Scenario: Unbonding a validator node which was not bonded to an existing network.
    Given: Single  Node Network
     And: A bonded Validator.
     When: New node joins the network.
     And: Deploys unbonding request.
     Then: Node still is not unbonded since it didn't bond to network.
     And: Starting from new block new node cannot be found in bonded validators set.

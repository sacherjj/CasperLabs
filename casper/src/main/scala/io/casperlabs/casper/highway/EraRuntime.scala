/** Class to encapsulate the message handling logic of messages in an era.
  *
  * It can create blocks/ballots and persist them, even new eras,
  * but it should not have externally visible side effects, i.e.
  * not communicate over the network.
  *
  * Persisting messages is fine: if we want to handle messages concurrently
  * we have to keep track of the validator sequence number and make sure
  * we cite our own previous messages.
  *
  * The handler methods will return a list of domain events,
  * and a list of future actions in the form of an ADT;
  * it's up to the supervisor protocol to broadcast them
  * and schedule followup actions.
  *
  * This should make testing easier: the return values are not opaque.
